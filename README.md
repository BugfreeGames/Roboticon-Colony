Roboticon Colony of York is a colonisation game for two players focusing on supply-and-demand economics, set on a futuristic University of York campus. Set in the far distant future, the University of York campus has become the location of a colony, where freeholders compete to raise money, crops, and other resources in order to both survive and become the Vice-Chancellor of the Colony.
